# Flight Schedule System

### Objective
The purpose of this project is to verify the concept of `Graph` **data structure**.


### Problem
An Airport company needs a system to `manage the flight schedule`. The system should be able to **store the cities** and **the relationship between cities** flight departures and destinations. Finally, the system shall be able to represent the flight schedule departure and destination.


### Test Case
``` java
class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        FlightSchedule flightSchedule = new FlightSchedule();

        flightSchedule.addCity(new City("Riyadh"));
        flightSchedule.addCity(new City("Toktyo"));
        flightSchedule.addCity(new City("Boston"));
        flightSchedule.addCity(new City("Kyoto"));
        flightSchedule.addCity(new City("Jeddah"));

        flightSchedule.addFlight(0, 1);
        flightSchedule.addFlight(0, 2);
        flightSchedule.addFlight(1, 3);
        flightSchedule.addFlight(1, 4);
        flightSchedule.addFlight(2, 3);
        flightSchedule.addFlight(3, 4);

        flightSchedule.printFlights();
    }
}
```
#### Output
```
Riyadh -> Toktyo
Riyadh -> Boston
Toktyo -> Kyoto
Toktyo -> Jeddah
Boston -> Kyoto
Kyoto -> Jeddah
```

### Implementation
- Create a class `City` with constructor and attribute:
    - `name` of type `String`
- Create a class `FlightSchedule` with the following:
    - Attributes:     
        - `cities` of type `ArrayList<City>` with initializer.
        - `flights` of type integer 2D array with a size of five, to store the flight departure and destination.
    - Methods:
        - Create a method `addCity` that takes a `City` object as a parameter and adds it to the `cities` list.
        - Create a method `addFlight` that takes two `City` objects as parameters and adds the flight departure and destination to the `flights` list.
        - Create a method `displayFlightSchedule` that displays the flight schedule departure and destination.

### Note
> The `FlightSchedule` class is actually a `graph` data structure, and the `City` is the vertex of the graph.
> You're required to `import java.util.ArrayList` to store the cities.



### Qualification to pass
- [ ] The code should run successfully.
- [ ] Write all required functions correctly `addCity()` `addFlight()`, and `displayFlightSchedule()`.
- [ ] The output should match the **test case**.
- [ ] Use the `Graph` **data structure** to solve the problem.
